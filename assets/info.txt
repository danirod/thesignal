THANKS

Well, I didn't expect to finish on time but here is another submission, and my first one made in Kotlin, yay!

Thank you to the libGDX community. As a whole entity. As a living entity. As a matrix of entities.

Also to the people who have been watching the development as it happened live on my Twitch channel (shameless plug: @danirod_). Specifically to the following people who acquired the privilege of being in the credits by using the channel reward:
